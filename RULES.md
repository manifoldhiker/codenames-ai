Codenames is a game for two teams. There is a grid of 25 words. Some of them are secretly assigned to the Red Team, some to the Blue Team. One player from each team is the Spymaster, and only Spymasters see which words belong to which team. Spymasters take turns giving clues to their teammates (Operatives), trying to lead them to guessing their team's words. The team that guesses all their words first wins the game.

Please note: Codenames Online is a tool that lets you play the game over the Internet, but it doesn’t enforce all the rules. Spymasters in particular need to know the rules so they can follow them.
Dividing into Teams
Divide all players into two teams, red and blue.

One player from each team should click on Join as Spymaster. He/she will then see the colors of the cards.

Everyone else should click on Join as Operative. They do not see the colors of the cards.

Giving Clues
Spymasters give clues. When it’s your turn to give a clue, tap some words in your color that you want to give a clue for. Then type in a one word clue that relates to all selected words. Your Operatives will only see the clue and the number of marked cards.

When you give a clue ...
... your Operatives only see the word and the number.

 

assassin cardWatch out for the black card – it’s an Assassin! Avoid clues that would lead to the assassin or to the other team's words.

 

Note: Some clues are not allowed, for example using any form of any word on the board. See Valid Clues later.
Guessing
Operatives guess the words based on the Spymaster’s clue.

You can discuss the clue with your teammates. You can also suggest a guess by tapping the card you think matches the clue.

To make your guess official, tap the  button. The game will then reveal the color of the chosen word.

 

If you guess a word of your team's color, you may guess again. You'll want to guess as many words as your Spymaster indicated.

Note: You can also guess unsolved clues from previous turns. See Number of Guesses later.
End of Turn
Your turn can end in one of three ways:

Guessing a word of the opponent's color or neutral color.

Ending guessing manually by clicking the button.

Reaching the maximum number of guesses (clue number + 1).

Winning and Losing
Teams alternate turns. A team wins once all their words have been guessed. They lose if they guess the Assassin!

Notes
Valid clues
Number of Guesses
The number in your clue is supposed to tell your team how many words relate to that clue. They can always guess one extra word, usually an unguessed word from previous turns.

If you need your Operatives to guess more extra words, you can manually select Infinity ∞. They can guess any number of words then (but they don't know how many words your current clue relates to).
You can also use Zero 0 for your clue. It also allows operatives to guess as many words as they want. The difference is that you are telling your teammates that your clue relates to no words of your color. You may use it for example to prevent them from guessing the Assassin or the opponent's word.

No matter what type of clue you use, your team always needs to try at least 1 guess.
