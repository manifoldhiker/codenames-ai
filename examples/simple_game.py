Codenames Simple Game Example

This file demonstrates the basic functionality of the Codenames game engine
without AI agents or debates. It shows how to:

1. Create a new game
2. Display the game board
3. Process clues and guesses, including invalid ones
4. Loop the game until completion

This serves as a simple introduction to the game's core functionality.
